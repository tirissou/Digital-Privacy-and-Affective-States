	title={Measuring shame and guilt by self-report questionnaires: A validation study},
	journal={Psychiatry research},
	volume={150},
	number={3},
	pages={313-325},
	note={ID: 271134},
	abstract={Quantitative assessment of shame and guilt using self-report questionnaires can help to understand the role of these emotions in various mental disorders. However, shame and guilt measures have predominantly been tested among healthy subjects that usually show low levels of guilt and shame. Thus, little is known about the comparative validity of different shame and guilt questionnaires in a population of shame- and guilt-prone persons with mental illness as compared to healthy subjects. This study used the Test of Self-Conscious Affect (TOSCA-3), the Personal Feelings Questionnaire (PFQ-2) and the Experiential Shame Scale (ESS) among 60 women with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and 60 healthy women. Intercorrelations of shame-proneness, guilt-proneness and state shame as well as their correlations with self-efficacy, empowerment, state and trait-anxiety, experiential avoidance, depression, and general psychopathology were assessed. In both groups, shame-proneness was moderately related to guilt-proneness, both as assessed by the TOSCA-3 and the PFQ-2. For the TOSCA-3, among healthy subjects shame-proneness was significantly correlated with other constructs while guilt-proneness was not. This difference turned largely insignificant among women with BPD. For the PFQ-2, shame- and guilt-proneness showed similar correlational patterns with other constructs in both groups. The guilt-proneness scale of the TOSCA-3 showed poor internal consistency. State shame (ESS) was strongly related to state anxiety in both groups, and its correlations with other constructs were similar to state anxiety. The discriminant validity of the TOSCA-3 to distinguish between shame- and guilt-proneness may be diminished in clinical samples. The measure of state shame (ESS) showed a large overlap with state anxiety.},

	title={Rationality-based beliefs affecting individual’s attitude and intention to use privacy controls on Facebook: An empirical investigation},
	journal={Computers in Human Behavior},
	volume={38},
	pages={159-173},
	note={ID: 271802},
	abstract={Online social networking sites like Facebook provides a fast and easy way to connect with friends and family. Users need to post and share their personal information in order to get the best possible experiences on Facebook. However, the spreading of private information can also lead to serious and harmful issues. Therefore, privacy becomes an important component in the use of Facebook and it is the user’s responsibility to protect his or her profile. This study draws upon the theory of planned behavior and the rational choice theory to investigate the rationality-based beliefs affecting individual’s attitude and intention to use privacy controls on Facebook. The results show that individual’s attitude toward using privacy controls is influenced by benefit of using privacy controls, cost of using privacy controls, and cost of not using privacy controls. Further, benefits of using privacy controls is shaped by beliefs regarding intrinsic benefit and resource safety; cost of not using privacy controls is shaped by beliefs regarding resource vulnerability, threat severity, privacy risk and privacy intrusion; and cost of using privacy controls is shaped by beliefs about intrinsic cost and work impediment. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed in the paper.},

	title={The privacy paradox – Investigating discrepancies between expressed privacy concerns and actual online behavior – A systematic literature review},
	journal={Telematics and Informatics},
	volume={34},
	number={7},
	pages={1038-1058},
	note={ID: 271579},
	abstract={Also known as the privacy paradox, recent research on online behavior has revealed discrepancies between user attitude and their actual behavior. More specifically: While users claim to be very concerned about their privacy, they nevertheless undertake very little to protect their personal data. This systematic literature review explores the different theories on the phenomenon known as the privacy paradox. Drawing on a sample of 32 full papers that explore 35 theories in total, we determined that a user’s decision-making process as it pertains to the willingness to divulge privacy information is generally driven by two considerations: (1) risk-benefit evaluation and (2) risk assessment deemed be none or negligible. By classifying in accordance with these two considerations, we have compiled a comprehensive model using all the variables mentioned in the discussed papers. The overall findings of the systematic literature review will investigate the nature of decision-making (rational vs. irrational) and the context in which the privacy paradox takes place, with a special focus on mobile computing. Furthermore, possible solutions and research limitation issues will be discussed.},

	journal={Consciousness and cognition},
	volume={17},

	pages={725-740},
	note={ID: 272616},
	abstract={How does shame differ from guilt? Empirical psychology has recently offered distinct and seemingly incompatible answers to this question. This article brings together four prominent answers into a cohesive whole. These are that (a) shame differs from guilt in being a social emotion; (b) shame, in contrast to guilt, affects the whole self; (c) shame is linked with ideals, whereas guilt concerns prohibitions and (d) shame is oriented towards the self, guilt towards others. After presenting the relevant empirical evidence, we defend specific interpretations of each of these answers and argue that they are related to four different dimensions of the emotions. This not only allows us to overcome the conclusion that the above criteria are either unrelated or conflicting with one another, it also allows us to tell apart what is constitutive from what is typical of them.},

	journal={Information Systems Research},
	volume={24},
	number={3},
	pages={579-595},
	note={28},
	abstract={Privacy is of prime importance to many individuals when they attempt to develop online social relationships. Nonetheless, it has been observed that individuals' behavior is at times inconsistent with their privacy concerns, e.g., they disclose substantial private information in synchronous online social interactions, even though they are aware of the risks involved. Drawing on the hyperpersonal framework and the privacy calculus perspective, this paper elucidates the interesting roles of privacy concerns and social rewards in synchronous online social interactions by examining the causes and the behavioral strategies that individuals utilize to protect their privacy. An empirical study involving 251 respondents was conducted in online chat rooms. Our results indicate that individuals utilize both self-disclosure and misrepresentation to protect their privacy and that social rewards help explain why individuals may not behave in accordance with their privacy concerns. In addition, we find that perceived anonymity of others and perceived intrusiveness affect both privacy concerns and social rewards. Our findings also suggest that higher perceived anonymity of self decreases individuals' privacy concerns, and higher perceived media richness increases social rewards. Generally, this study contributes to the information systems literature by integrating the hyperpersonal framework and the privacy calculus perspective to identify antecedents of privacy trade-off and predict individuals' behavior in synchronous online social interactions.]},

	journal={Information Systems Journal},
	volume={25},
	number={6},
	pages={607-635},
	abstract={Existing research on information privacy has mostly relied on the privacy calculus model, which views privacy-related decision-making as a rational process where individuals weigh the anticipated risks of disclosing personal data against the potential benefits. In this research, we develop an extension to the privacy calculus model, arguing that the situation-specific assessment of risks and benefits is bounded by (1) pre-existing attitudes or dispositions, such as general privacy concerns or general institutional trust, and (2) limited cognitive resources and heuristic thinking. An experimental study, employing two samples from the USA and Switzerland, examined consumer responses to a new smartphone application that collects driving behavior data and provided converging support for these predictions. Specifically, the results revealed that a situation-specific assessment of risks and benefits fully mediates the effect of dispositional factors on information disclosure. In addition, the results showed that privacy assessment is influenced by momentary affective states, indicating that consumers underestimate the risks of information disclosure when confronted with a user interface that elicits positive affect.

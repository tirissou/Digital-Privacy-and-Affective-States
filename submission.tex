\section{Introduction}

Privacy literacy does not necessarily translate into privacy conscious behavior — the great privacy paradox. To describe this seemingly irrational decision-making process, many studies have explored different models of this privacy calculus \cite{Kehr2015}\cite{Jian2013}. These privacy-infringing decisions despite purported privacy concerns may result in negative affective states such as guilt and shame. \\

Question 1: To what extent are guilt or shame the result of privacy infringing decision-making? Is there a correlation between the privacy literacy of an individual and the amount of guilt/shame?

Hypothesis: We believe that guilt and shame will be felt in these situations. We hypothesize that the privacy literacy of an individual will positively correlate with the extent of these negative affective states. \\

Question 2: Does engaging in privacy-preserving behavior result in positive affective states?

Hypothesis 2: We predict that such affectives states will not correlate that strongly with privacy preserving behavior. \\

Question 3: Do these affectives states motivate people to adopt more privacy-preserving behavior?

Hypothesis 3: We predict that both negative affective states are not effective and that positive affective states are effective at motivating such behavior.


\section{Related Works}
\subsection{Privacy paradox, privacy calculus and affects}
The privacy paradox’s existence is for certain, as Barth and de Jong establish in their 2017 literature review. Contextual and environmental circumstances impact the rationality of decision-making, especially online. Studies demonstrate that irrationality in decisions-making regarding privacy is not necessarily circumvented through privacy literacy. \cite{Barth2017}

Some research took the direction of looking at privacy-preserving behavior as being the irrational decision [Cohen]. However, much recent literature assumes that decisions being made are rational insomuch as there is a level of privacy calculus that individuals perform when assessing the risks and rewards of disclosing information or violating their privacy \cite{Kehr2015}\cite{Jian2013}. Affect and affective states (emotions and moods) have been included in recent models of privacy calculus. These frameworks provide the basis for how we conceptualize affective impact on decision making regarding privacy.

\subsection{Negative affective states}
Teroni and Deonna explore in their paper the differentiation of shame and guilt. Their distinctions are the foundation for how we conceptualize negative affective states. We use the questionnaire as detailed in \cite{Rusch2007} as a model for how we build our survey.
\subsection{Positive affective states and Privacy}
Research places importance on the perceived social benefits that come from self-disclosure of information online in synchronous interactive environments\cite{Jian2013}. Such perception of benefits generates positive affective states from such divulsion of information.

In line with the investigation of positive affective states as a motivating factor in behavior shaping \cite{Taneja2014}, we are interested in how positive affective states as a result to making privacy-conscious and privacy-preserving decisions correlate with frequency of such decision-making.


\section{Methodology}
This is a mixed methods study. Surveys are sent out first to find correlations between privacy preserving behavior and the affective states that reinforce them to varying success. Interviews will be conducted with respondents from the survey who want to participate.
\pagebreak
\subsection{Questionnaires}
\nopagebreak The survey is designed to answer:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What privacy protecting behavior respondents actively engage in (from a list of common ones),
    \item How regular and consistent this behavior is
    \item The extent to which respondents feel good or bad when they engage in privacy-protective behavior
    \item The extent to which respondents feel good or bad when they do not engage in privacy-protective behavior
\end{itemize}

\noindent The survey was modeled after multiple established surveys:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Surveys to gauge privacy perception and behavior
    \item Use established questionnaires for measuring negative affects \cite{Rusch2007}
    \item Design questions with best practices for digital methodology in mind \cite{Hampton2017}
\end{itemize}

Quantitative data is analyzed to find correlations between behavior and affect.
\subsection{Interviews}
Findings in the quantitative data will be used by interviewers to help guide interviewees through semi-structured interviews. The objective of the interviews is to \textbf{a)} collect detailed descriptions of the affective states that are experienced before, during, and after engaging in privacy-related behavior, and \textbf{b)} explore the extent to which privacy-related behavior is shaped by the affective states surrounding them. Prior to addressing these, the interviewer will establish what the interviewee's privacy-related habits are and the extent of their knowledge about privacy. \\

The main guiding questions for the interviews are as follow:\\

\textbf{QUESTION 1}: How private and confidential is your information when you’re online? Are there certain activities that are riskier/safer than others?

\textbf{QUESTION 2}: Do you take any protective measures when using the internet? Why or why not?

\textbf{QUESTION 3}: How does the way that you currently browse the internet make you feel in regards to how secure you believe your information to be?

\section{Findings}
\subsection{Survey}
67 responses were collected from people over the age of 18. Respondents were primarily  college students, of which a majority are enrolled at Oberlin College.
